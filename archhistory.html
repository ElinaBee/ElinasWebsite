                <div class="box">I came to UK in September 2013 to study architecture in Manchester School of Architecture. At the time it seemed like a great idea as I studied architecture in high school and obtained an Architectural technician diploma and University seemed like a logical continuation. But long behold .. around end of the second year I started to realise that this career is not for me. </div>

                <div class="box">I have displayed images here of the Art School in which the Architecture School was situated. The building itself design wise is inspiring, but not enough to persuade me to study architecture further. Also on this page you can find couple of my university works from 2nd and 3rd year. </div>
